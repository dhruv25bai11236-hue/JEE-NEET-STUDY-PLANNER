                                          **JEE/NEET Study Planner**

**Problem statement:**
Students preparing for competitive exams like JEE and NEET face a vast syllabus across Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology. A major challenge that students faced is ineffective time management and also they failed to structure a long-term study plan that covers every chapter before the exam date. Many students struggle to determine how many hours to study daily based on the time left, which books to consult, and how to balance different subjects, leading to stress and inefficient preparation.

**Scope of the project:**
The project aims to develop a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application that acts as a personalized "Success Roadmap" for students. The scope includes:

•**Exam Support**: Catering specifically to JEE and NEET spirants.

•	**Syllabus Coverage:** comprehensively managing the syllabus for Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology.

•	**Time Management**: distinct algorithms to calculate study hours based on the urgency of the exam date.

•	**Resource Planning**: integrating database-like structures for standard book recommendations and subject-specific study tips.
•	**Output**: Generating a readable daily schedule and a long-term, chapter-by-chapter calendar plan.

**Target users:**

•	**High School Students (Class 11 & 12):** Students currently enrolled in science streams aiming for engineering or medical colleges.

•	**Droppers/Gap Year Students:** Individuals dedicating a full year to exam preparation who need a rigorous schedule.

•	**Self-Study Aspirants**: Students preparing without coaching institutes who require a structured guide to keep them on track.

**High-level features:**

•	**Dynamic Countdown & Study Intensity:** The system accepts the exam date, calculates the remaining days, and automatically adjusts the recommended daily study hours (ranging from 6 to 12 hours) based on how close the exam is.

•	**Automated Schedule Generation:** Creates a detailed daily timetable with specific time slots for study sessions and breaks.
•	**Subject & Resource Guidance:** Provides curated lists of best-selling preparation books (e.g., HC Verma, NCERT) and specific study tips for every subject based on the user's chosen exam path.

•	**Chapter-wise Roadmap:** Randomizes and allocates the entire syllabus into a day-by-day plan, ensuring every topic is covered within the available timeframe.

•	**Revision Strategy:** Includes a dedicated "3-Day Countdown Strategy" for the final days before the exam and motivational mantras to manage stress.
